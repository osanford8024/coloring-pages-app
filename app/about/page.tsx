      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>PaziPagesAI</strong> was created with one simple mission:
        to make high-quality, kid-friendly coloring pages available to
        everyone—instantly and for free. As parents and creators ourselves,
        we know how valuable creative activities can be for young learners.
        Coloring helps children build focus, confidence, imagination, and
        emotional expression, and we wanted to make those benefits accessible
        regardless of artistic skill or available resources.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Using advanced AI technology, PaziPagesAI transforms ideas into
        clean, printable black-and-white coloring pages that fit perfectly
        on standard 8.5×11″ paper. Whether it’s a dinosaur riding a scooter,
        a kitten baking cupcakes, or a custom prompt created by your child,
        the goal is to make creativity fun, safe, and easy. Every image is
        generated within strict guidelines to avoid inappropriate content,
        ensuring a family-friendly experience suitable for classrooms, homes,
        therapy offices, and after-school programs.

        Why PaziPagesAI Exists
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Many coloring sites rely heavily on ads, outdated clip art, or
        low-resolution images that don’t print well. We wanted to solve that
        problem by offering modern, clean line-art illustrations that are
        both customizable and high resolution. Teachers often struggle to
        find age-appropriate resources. Parents look for quick activities to
        keep their children engaged. Therapists use art for emotional
        regulation. PaziPagesAI makes it possible for all of them to create
        what they need in seconds.

        A Safe and Kid-Friendly Experience
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We take child safety seriously. Prompts are guided by best practices
        to avoid copyrighted characters, violent themes, unsafe objects, or
        content not suitable for young audiences. Every improvement we make
        focuses on keeping the platform simple, safe, and designed for family
        use. No login is required to browse the gallery, and no personal data
        is needed to generate images.
